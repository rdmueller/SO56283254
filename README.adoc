see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56283254/overwrite-repository-definition-in-gradle-subproject/56326085

a `./gradlew tasks` fails with the message that the script plugin has a dependency that can't be resolved:

```
A problem occurred evaluating project ':subproject'.
> Could not resolve all artifacts for configuration 'classpath'.
   > Could not find org.asciidoctor:asciidoctor-gradle-plugin:1.5.3.
     Searched in the following locations:
       - https://example.com/m2/org/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/1.5.3/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin-1.5.3.pom
       - https://example.com/m2/org/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin/1.5.3/asciidoctor-gradle-plugin-1.5.3.jar
     Required by:
         unspecified:unspecified:unspecified
```

Imagine for the oment that `example.com` is a repository behind your firewall - unreachable.

Do you manage to point this pedendency to another repository without changing the subproject? Only the main project?
